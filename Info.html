<h2>List of MS Degrees and their required courses</h2>
<br><br>

<b>--> Masters of Science in Computer Science</b><br>

The Master of Science in Computer Science offers students the opportunity to combine a sound foundation in computer science with concentrated knowledge in the latest developments in particular areas. Our faculty have expertise in many areas of computer science, including algorithms and theory, artificial intelligence, computer gaming, computer networks, databases, data mining, graphics, image and video processing, information security and assurance, information systems, knowledge engineering, pattern recognition, programming languages, real- time systems, robotics, software engineering, and vision.

<br><br>
<b>-> Degree Requirements</b>
<br>  

Master of Science in Computer Science is a breadth-based program. Students are required to complete 30 credits of graduate courses. Courses are grouped in the following five broad areas:
<p>
<ul>
			<li>CS 583 - Analysis of Algorithms</li>
			<li>CS 555 - Database management</li>
			<li>CS 580 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</li>

<b>--> Masters in Information Security and Assurance</b><br>

This program satisfies the dual needs of preparing graduates to (1) fill the need for information security and assurance professionals to work in a wide variety of capacities to protect the information systems of different types of organizations, and to support the nationâ€™s information infrastructure and (2) conducting advanced research and in information security and assurance. Consequently, the degree provides technical knowledge and skills to understand information security, and provides specialized theoretical knowledge and experimental experience.

<br><br>
<b>-> Degree Requirements</b>
<br>

To provide the necessary background and fundamentals of information systems security and assurance, the program has three courses that are required of all students:

<p>
<ul>
<li>ISA 562 - Information Security Theory and Practice</li>
<li>ISA 656 - Network Security</li> 
<li>INFS 612 Principles and Practice of Communication Networks OR CS 555 - Computer Communications and Networking</li>
<li>Note: Students selecting the Network and System Security concentration must take CS 555</li> 
</ul>
<br><hr>
</p><br><br>

<b>--> Masters in Information Systems</b><br>

This professional degree program focuses on the technical, managerial and policy issues associated with designing, building and maintaining information systems in organizations. Data, information and knowledge are crucial to the modern enterprise, and the MS in Information Systems (MSIS) program addresses both the theoretical and engineering aspects of specifying, designing, implementing and managing large-scale information systems.

<br><br>
<b>-> Degree Requirements</b><br>
<br>

Four core courses (12 credits) are required of all IS graduates:

<p>
<li>INFS 612 Principles and Practices of Communication Networks</li> 
<li>INFS 614 Database Management</li> 
<li>INFS 622 Information Systems Analysis and Design</li> 
<li>ISA 562 Information Security Theory and Practice</li>
</ul>
<br><hr>
</p><br><br>

<b>--> Masters of Science in Software Engineering</b><br>

The Master of Science in Software Engineering provides specialized knowledge and experience in developing and modifying large, complex software systems. It emphasizes technical and management aspects of the software engineering process. Software engineering is an established discipline based on requirement analysis, design, construction, testing, maintenance, economics, and management issues of software engineering. A pragmatic approach to problem solving is the hallmark of a software engineer. Software engineers are concerned with the theoretical and practical aspects of technology, cost, and social impact of software systems that are both effective and efficient.
